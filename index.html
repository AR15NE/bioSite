          <h2>Meet Zoey</h2>
          <p> Zoey is an energetic, spunky, and creative 5-year-old. She is often described by others as full of life and energy. She has a genuine love for learning and a desire to do things well. As a child with ADHD, Zoey has learned how to embrace who she is while still trying to do her best and care for others. So far in her short life, Zoey has accomplished many things. In 2019, she earned the title of best big sister when her younger sister Zaylee was born. She graduated preschool and began kindergarten in the fall of 2023. She has earned the title of star student for her efforts in class and her kind relationships with her fellow classmates. </p>

          <p>Zoey has worked hard to learn more about herself and how to lean into her strengths while also trying her best and thinking of those around her. In January, she was able to read her first book from start to finish without needing a helper. She is also an accomplished artist with an entire showroom of paintings and creations. Zoey has many aspirations for the future. In terms of long-term goals, she is currently undecided between a career choice of a veterinarian or monster truck driver. She is looking forward to a princess wedding and being a mom. In the next year, Zoey hopes to graduate kindergarten and enter first grade. She also aspires to be the fastest soccer player on her team come the 2024 spring season.</p>
